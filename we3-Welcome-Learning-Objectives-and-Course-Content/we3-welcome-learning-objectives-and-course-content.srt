00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:05,635
Welcome to part III of our MOOC "Web Engineering".

1
00:00:07,727 --> 00:00:11,735
My name is Klaus Quibeldey-Cirkel. I am the instructor of this course.

2
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:34,135
The language of the videos is German, because this MOOC is part of a German university lecture at Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen (THM) and our students have a right to German lesson.

3
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:45,469
Anyway: In our times of globalization it doesn't hurt to have listened to one or another foreign language once in a while.

4
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,282
Now, let's get to our introductory video.

5
00:00:49,532 --> 00:00:53,032
I will briefly explain the learning objectives of this course,

6
00:00:53,282 --> 00:01:02,000
and the prerequisites for finishing the course successfully.

7
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:06,735
I will introduce you to our two projects:

8
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:12,405
A term project everyone needs to do.

9
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:26,869
And an optional, voluntary Scrum project in September in which you may participate offshore, i.e. from home online.

10
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:36,935
Finally, I'll give you the course dates for the homework and the final exam.

11
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:40,685


12
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:44,435
First, the course objectives:

13
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:51,269
There are two main proficiency objectives we want to convey:

14
00:01:51,519 --> 00:02:06,135
1. Mastering the maintenance challenges of Web apps that need to be changed and brought into production often.

15
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:21,535
This means, the first objective is about engineering skills like build automation, performance and browser testing, and continuous deployment.

16
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:30,402
That is, iterating the process of getting your code ready for production once your have edited your changes.

17
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:47,069
2. What is special about this MOOC, is that you will have a chance to practice collaboration in a continuous delivery environment during two weeks in September:

18
00:02:47,319 --> 00:03:01,735
Practicing soft kills/team skills by collaborating with your peers, communicating, and coordinating.

19
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:05,485
We will offer this project during a two-week offshore scrum project in September.

20
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:21,135
You will work together on a project with the students of THM.

21
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:33,269
It will be very interesting to organize both "offshore" and "onshore" students together in a project and to elaborate on it on a daily basis

22
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:40,935
and to come up with a release at the end of the project.

23
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:45,135
What will this Scrum project be about?

24
00:03:45,385 --> 00:04:07,535
We want to further develop a prototype app called THMCards, i.e. add new features known from apps like "Quizduell" and others.

25
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:21,202
This project is an super modern open source, single page and full stack javascript app.

26
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:29,269
With a NoSQL database and Node.js as backend.

27
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:35,469
Let's get to the prerequisites:

28
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:39,219


29
00:04:39,469 --> 00:05:06,604
The must-have hardware prerequisites are:
1. access to a fast internet connection
2. a modern multi-core computer (desktop/notebook) with at least 4 GB RAM

30
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:42,002
The software prerequisites are:
1. any OS will do, we will use a virtual environment
2. you need to a have a Unix/Linux terminal/command shell installed on your computer

31
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:54,400
If you use a Windows OS, you need to make sure that your command shell offers the full functionality of a bash shell.

32
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:06,069
3. Oracle Virtual Box should be installed as virtualization software; however, we can talk about alternatives.

33
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:11,469
What are the brain ware prerequisites?


34
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:21,219
Web Engineering III builds on the competences gained in Web Engineering I and II.

35
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:36,735
It is not necessary that you have attended those two courses, but it is required that you have the knowledge you could have acquired in those courses.

36
00:06:36,985 --> 00:07:02,269
1. You should have a solid command of Unix/Linux commands, of HTML5, and JavaScript, because we will build, test and deploy apps based on these techniques.


37
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:11,669
You should be willing to participate in a two-week Scrum project.

38
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:23,409
However, attending the Scrum project is not required to get the Certificate of Accomplishment or the Statement of Participation.

39
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:31,159
This slides gives an overview about the six chapters of this MOOC.

40
00:07:36,719 --> 00:08:15,744
The tools I marked with a curly bracket are the tools that we will learn to use based on the ARSnova app which most of you got to know through some surveys during part 1 and 2 of the MOOC. 

41
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:32,869
All these tools are available as open source tools online, the build pipeline, the project environment, GitLab and the project management tool Redmine.

42
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:41,135
By practicing these tools on the productive, running ARSnova app, you will be able to study them in depth.

43
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:51,334
There are four Homework Assignments planned for this course:

44
00:08:51,584 --> 00:09:07,949
All of these assignments serve to prove that you have understood the contents of the videos and additional materials provided in this course

45
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,699
and that you are able to apply that knowledge using the respective tools.

46
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:29,335
You will learn to create test plans with Apache JMeter 

47
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:45,615
by putting the ARSnova app under load and then watching the response times and if the app works as expected.

48
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:50,735
You will use Selenium for GUI tests,

49
00:09:50,985 --> 00:10:03,002
that means, you will script the interaction with the browser and play back the scripts in different browser products

50
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:10,069
to check if the app is cross-browser compatible. 

51
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,819
We will use Jenkins as our build environment.

52
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:27,002
The objective here is being able to formulate and execute Ant Maven build scripts.

53
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:55,869
SonarCube is an open source analytics tools, that creates a static analysis of ARSnova and produces different metrics that we will learn how to interpret.

54
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:59,619


55
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:03,369
Now, let's have a look at the term project:

56
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:17,069
For the term project, it is absolutely necessary that you provide an open source HTML5 app which you have developed yourself or

57
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:29,547
that you can develop such an app within the next few weeks. This app should be have a certain degree of usefulness.

58
00:11:29,797 --> 00:11:35,072
This app will be published on the web and be publicly available.

59
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:41,602
The sources (your Git repository) will also be made public for learning purposes.

60
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:54,202
At the end of the term project, you will have to submit your term project in the form of the following list of deliveries:

61
00:11:54,452 --> 00:12:12,680
- You have to publish your source code in a public Git repository. Your sources must include a so called Vagrant file.

62
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:22,622
The vagrant file allows creating virtual development, test and production environments via a terminal command locally on your computer.

63
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:43,734
- Apply the homework assignments you practiced on the ARSnova app to your app:

64
00:12:43,984 --> 00:12:48,135
i.e. test plans with Apache JMeter,

65
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:52,935
test scripts created with Selenium

66
00:12:53,185 --> 00:13:00,267
the Maven Ant/Jenkins build scripts,

67
00:13:00,517 --> 00:13:06,269
and the QA metrics generated with SonarCube.

68
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,019


69
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:24,667
We will provide you with a publicly available source code management infrastructure for your term project

70
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:28,167
which you may also use for other projects if you like.

71
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:33,869
The SCM infrastructure will include the following tools (among others):

72
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:41,070
These are just the main tools that cover the learning objectives:

73
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,669
GitLab, a version management hosting system

74
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:54,934
comparable to GitHub but offering the possibility to add private repositories.

75
00:13:55,184 --> 00:14:05,402
The build environment set up with Jenkins (formerly Hudson)

76
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:20,002
The project management tool Redmine including the Scrum plugin Backlogs.

77
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:36,269
CloudControl - introduced in Web Engineering I and II - as cloud hosting service for your web apps.

78
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,019


79
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:43,769
What to expect from the final exam?

80
00:14:44,019 --> 00:15:08,735
There will be 10 questions about the contents of all six chapters of Web Engineering III that need to be answered within 60 minutes.

81
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:18,669
During the final exam you will be asked to submit your term project. 

82
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,802
The final exam will take place during the last week of July.

83
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:27,552
The grading process depends on the type of certificate you want to achieve:

84
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:46,214
For a Statement of Participation, your peers will review your project.

85
00:15:46,464 --> 00:16:03,269
For a paid Certificate of Accomplishment, the project will be graded by a course instructor.

86
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:11,269
Your project will then be commented and your grade will be stated on the certificate.

87
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,144
There will also be a diploma supplement stating the course contents.

88
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:34,002
Your identity will be verified and it will be certified, that the certificate was acquired under supervision and. 

89
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:37,752
The authenticity of the certificate will also be guaranteed.

90
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:44,202
What types of certificates can be obtained in this MOOC?

91
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:54,269
The prerequisites for all types of certificates are the same:

92
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:22,469
- your activity progress indicators must show 80% fulfillment on all units which can be achieved by watching the course videos and answering the quizzes

93
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:29,219
- submission of all homework assignments

94
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:38,069
- passing of the final exam

95
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:46,867
- your term project must fulfill the requirements

96
00:17:47,117 --> 00:18:01,069
After successfully finishing all of the above requirements, you can download a Statement of Participation free of charge

97
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:17,069
To get a paid Certificate of Accomplishment, your ID needs to be verified. The proctored exam will take place online. The fee is 99 Euro.

98
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:39,402
Due to popular demand, we will introduce a new, special kind of performance record in this third part of Web Engineering.

99
00:18:39,652 --> 00:19:01,482
A few years ago, the Mozilla foundation launched Open Badges (see http://openbadges.org).

100
00:19:01,732 --> 00:19:14,669
Open Badges are digital indicators of real world skills and achievements (see Wikipedia).

101
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:21,735
The visual representations contain further information (metadata ) that is displayed when someone clicks on such a badge.

102
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:48,485
Such metadata include the issuer of the badge and the criteria/requirements that were necessary to obtain the badge.

103
00:19:48,735 --> 00:20:08,269
It may also contain much more information like the course contents etc. The person eligible for such a badge may publish it on his/her website, blog, wiki or wherever on the internet he/she seems fit.

104
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:24,135
To obtain Open Badges from THM, you need to fulfill two prerequisites:

105
00:20:24,385 --> 00:20:36,885
1. You need to finish this third part of Web Engineering successfully by acquiring a Statement of Participation.

106
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:44,202
2.You need to participation successfully in the two-week Scrum Project in September.

107
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:50,135
These badges will be issued free of charge.

108
00:20:50,385 --> 00:20:51,935


109
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:55,945
Finally, some important course dates:

110
00:20:56,195 --> 00:21:09,469
The homework assignments will be published on a weekly basis at the end of each weekly chapter. 

111
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:18,669
Altogether, there will be 4 homework. You will have two weeks to finish and submit each assignment.

112
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:25,869
However, there will be some overlap, because we want to finish the course within a timeframe of 6-7 weeks.

113
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:40,802
The final exam will take place during the last week of July. It's up to you to decide when you want to take the exam within this timeframe.

114
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:46,202
The exam lasts 60 minutes and may not be interrupted during this time.

115
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:55,069
The optional offshore Scrum project will take place during two weeks in September.

116
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:58,819
We will determine those two weeks by the help of an ARSnova survey.

117
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:02,569


118
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:08,935
Good luck with the videos, the quizzes, the homework and your project.
