00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,642
In this screencast, I want to explain the structure of an Apache JMeter test plan.

1
00:00:13,642 --> 00:00:20,042
 I will use the ARSnova use case "Instant Feedback" as an example.

2
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:29,442
Let's start with the system under test, ARSnova,

3
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:36,562
and look at the scenario "Instant Feedback"

4
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:50,962
We start ARSnova in our vagrant-production machine.

5
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:55,712
First, you log in as guest.

6
00:00:55,962 --> 00:01:06,682
Next, you enter a session that you have created before, in this case PerfTest.

7
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:14,642
By tapping on "Give Feedback" and choosing a Feedback option, you can give the teacher feedback if you can follow the lecture.

8
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:28,482
When we do our performance test later, the bars in this diagram will reflect the actions of the virtual users.

9
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:36,962
Later, when you perform the use case under load, you can tap the icons on this page directly (without having to tap on "Give Feedback on the preceding page).

10
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:41,642
Now, let's get to the test plan.

11
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:45,392
I have prepared two scenarios:

12
00:01:45,642 --> 00:02:06,482
The first scenario (Small Lecture Hall) with 10 virtual users who start the scenario within 5 seconds (ramp up period) and run the use case once (loop count 1)

13
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:36,682
The second scenario (Large Lecture Hall), is the same as before, but with 100 simultaneous virtual users.

14
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:47,362
As User Defined Variable there is the Session ID.

15
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:58,642
When you work with your own session, you will have to change the value for session key.

16
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:04,282
Next, the users have to log in, this will be done via the Guest Login.

17
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:08,032
For this purpose, we use a Random Variable with randomly generated values.

18
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:17,242
These values will be generated for each user separately (Options > Per Thread(User): True).

19
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:35,562
In real life, the users will then consider which option they want to tap. This period is called Think Time oder Wait Time.

20
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:48,922
We assume that this Think Time will be 1 to 5 seconds, and will configure this Think Time as a Random Variable for each user individually.

21
00:03:49,172 --> 00:04:01,442
Then, the users need to give feedback in the way described before. There are 4 values.

22
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:05,802
From "I can follow you" to "You have lost me".

23
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:12,602
Internally, these values are defined as integer values 0 to 3.

24
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:22,722
Again, the values are generated randomly for each user individually.

25
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:50,482
For the samplers (HTTP request controllers) we define - for convenience's sake - the URL and the port.

26
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:54,232
In our case, the Web Server is localhost (or 127.0.0.1) and the Port Number 8080.

27
00:04:54,482 --> 00:05:09,562
We want to simulate a realistic browser, therefore we tell JMeter to load all resources in each run (Retrieve All Embedded Resources).

28
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:24,402
That is, images, JavaScript (although JMeter does not interpret JS), videos, audio, external sources etc.

29
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:30,282
We allow four parallel HTTP requests on a TCP connection (Use concurrent pool. Size: 4).

30
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:37,682
ARSnova uses cookies for the security architecture in the backend.

31
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:57,842
In the HTTP Header Manager, we tell JMeter that we use application/json as exchange format for all requests and responses.

32
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:02,562
Therefore, we can define this format as a general header value.

33
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:17,242
No, we will get to the activities the virtual user has to perform in the use case scenario "Give Feedback" of this test plan.

34
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:20,992
First, the user has to log in. In the HTTP Request form you can see the detailed data that is exchanged.

35
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:37,962
It is a GET request. The necessary GET-parameters are type, user, and role. The user Guest ID was defined as a random variable.

36
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:46,402
Once the user is logged in, he/she needs to log in to a session.

37
00:06:46,652 --> 00:06:57,762
To do this, the session ID has to be added to the URI in the path field: i.e. session/$(SESSIONKEY).

38
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:18,162
Then the number of active users is queried (indicated by the badges on the house icon on the start page of a session) using the path /session/$(SESSIONKEY)/activeusercount.

39
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:29,362
Next, the actual scenario starts. It is embedded in a Loop Controller which repeats the scenario 10 times. 

40
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:37,642
That is, the virtual user gives his/her feedback ten times.

41
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:49,442
Between each of these actions, there is a random Think Time of 1 to 5 seconds. In the Constant Timer the Thread Delay is set to the Think Time variable ($(TIMER))

42
00:07:49,692 --> 00:08:13,762
Give Feedback is a POST request with the respective body data, in this case only a number as a code for the selected option $(FEEDBACK).

43
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:26,882
Next, the feedback result is queried.

44
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:33,442
The number of feedbacks is indicated by the badge on the feedback icon.

45
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:39,042
Once the loop is over, the user is logged out (Guest Logout).

46
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:48,162
We have defined some listeners.

47
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:53,042
As you may well know by now, we can add many more.

48
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:59,202
I have chosen some of the plugins from the Google Code Project. 

49
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:05,562
I will explain them briefly.

50
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:16,642
These are standard listeners. The scenarios are listed. But let me best explain this with an example.

51
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:33,642
Let's delete all sampler data of the preceding run and then run the test plan again.

52
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:42,562
You can see that the virtual users log in linearly.

53
00:09:42,812 --> 00:09:46,312
The bar chart shows that the first users have already given their feedback.

54
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:51,202
Let's walk through the individual views.

55
00:09:51,452 --> 00:10:04,002
The Aggregate Report provides a table with the scenario and the individual actions in that scenario.

56
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:21,202
The Result Tree show the activities as a list. You can have a look at the protocol of each individual request and response. 

57
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:24,082
The results are also available as a table.

58
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,322
The next Listener is the Load Profile

59
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:32,322
The graph shows, that the 100 users logged in within 5 seconds.

60
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:44,202
Next a very popular metric, Hits per Second.

61
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:50,002
At the beginning, when the 100 users were logged in, we have some vigorous swings.

62
00:10:50,252 --> 00:10:58,242
Out of these two, you can build a composite graph.

63
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:14,082
For example, you can overlay the Load Profile with the Hits per Second (at the moment, there is no data, we will wait until the next run).

64
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:20,082
The next listener shows the Response Times Over Time for the individual activities.

65
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:46,922
The scenario has almost finished. Now we could test the user experience under load by tapping on the icons and observing the reaction of the system.

66
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:58,602
As you can see, now it takes a while until you can see a reaction when we tap an icon. At the second and third tap the reaction is again faster.

67
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:07,922
Looking closely, we see that the scenario is already finished and there was no load anymore.

68
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:11,672
We should have performed the test while the 100 users were active (KQC moves the mouse cursor around an area in the diagram).

69
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:27,082
The red line represents the users. The blue line represents the session (login). After 16 seconds the last user has logged in.

70
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:53,802
Then the actual use case is performed: 100 users giving feedback (green line), 10 times in a row, superimposed ...

71
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:57,552
After having given their feedback, the users begin to log off (brown line).

72
00:12:57,802 --> 00:13:05,682


73
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:10,802
Now we can work with the Composite listener.

74
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:15,282
There is a list of all available sources.

75
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:21,722
Now you can start overlapping graphs to draw conclusions.

76
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:29,562
This is the load profile.

77
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:34,162
Now we add the Server Hits per Second.

78
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:58,242
The composed graph shows heavy traffic at the beginning during the login, while it is quite regular during the actual use case scenario of giving feedback.

79
00:13:58,492 --> 00:14:02,002
During logout, the swings are again more vigorous.

80
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:12,722
You can now add others listeners you had activated before.

81
00:14:12,972 --> 00:14:22,842
It is also interesting to have a look at the successful and failed transactions.

82
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:26,592
In this case, there were no failed transactions.

83
00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:45,162
My high-performance iMac with 4 cores and 16 GB RAM did not produce any failures.

84
00:14:45,412 --> 00:15:00,162
I recommend having a look at the performance of your system as well, the impact of the scenario on your CPU, memory utilization etc.

85
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:08,322
The task of the homework assignment is to run two scenarios in parallel.

86
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:16,842
To do this, you have to configure the test plan accordingly.

87
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:20,962
Also, you are supposed to limit the individual scenarios in time.

88
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:27,802
All these settings are available in the options. You will learn about all these options while you work through the documentation, videos and other material.
