Ladies and Gentlemen, my experience as a teacher shows that its necessary to show students the way to achieve a target very clearly.

1
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:28,682
The objective of this chapter is explain the homework and the way to get there by working through the individual units

2
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:39,042
on the iversity platform one by one before starting with the homework.

3
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:46,202
Let's walk through the units of this chapter together.

4
00:00:46,452 --> 00:01:02,602
In this unit, we will introduce you to a simple old benchmarking tool, Apache Bench.

5
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:07,402
This tool comes with the Apache HTTPServer.

6
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:18,042
The command here shows you how you can use Apache Bench to generate a synthetic repetitive load.

7
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:21,792
You may try this out but please don't increase the number of users beyond 1000.

8
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:31,282
Note: Please take part in the discussion in the section "Additional Materials" below the Focus Box.

9
00:01:31,532 --> 00:01:44,322
These are discussion exercises in which you are supposed to take part and substantiate your opinions with the knowledge you have acquired by watching the videos and reading the additional materials.

10
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:57,642
Only if you write, argue or even fight, your learning will be sustainable.

11
00:01:57,892 --> 00:02:11,482
In this chapter, discuss the pros and cons of a benchmark tool like Apache Bench for load and performance testing.

12
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:17,322
You may ask: How do I know that?

13
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:30,882
Studying means reading, researching, actually going to the library and finding sources.

14
00:02:31,132 --> 00:02:41,082
Preparing yourself for a lecture with your own position and argue your case.

15
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:55,042
It's not enough to just repeat the things you are shown in the videos but you need to figure things out for yourself by studying the (additional) materials we provide.

16
00:02:55,292 --> 00:03:02,602
So, please pay attention to the discussion tasks in the individual units.

17
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:19,202
The next unit recommends a 60-minute educational video by Mr. Prusak, Vice President Customer Success at BlazeMeter.

18
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:22,952
BlazeMeter is a company that is into JMeter.

19
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:48,602
Well, 60 minutes is quite a long time, but it's worth it. If you don't like that video, have a look at the long list of videos that deal with Apache JMeter.

20
00:03:48,852 --> 00:04:02,362
Also, have a look at the original user documentation which you will find at http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/index.html

21
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:11,242
I strongly recommend you study the first 4/5 chapters.

22
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:33,522
These chapters contain step by step instructions for all activities required in dealing with JMeter. 

23
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:49,002
These materials are sufficient, you don't need to buy a book. However, if you want to buy one, you find a recommendation in the respective unit.

24
00:04:49,252 --> 00:05:08,202
Next, we will walk you through the performance test of ARSnova (this is not intended for you to just follow some clicks )

25
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:19,802
What you see here is a live detail of the performance graphs (here: use case "Give Feedback").

26
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:23,552
You can download the test plan (available in the "References and Attachments" section below the Focus Box).

27
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:36,442
You can then study this plan in detail and: It is part of your homework assignment.

28
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:45,602
While testing the load is one thing, you also have to record the performance in the production environment.

29
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:51,882
For this purpose, we will introduce you to the popular monitoring tool Munin.

30
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:55,632
Of course, for ARSnova.

31
00:05:55,882 --> 00:06:04,642
You will be able to answer the quiz questions if you start Munin for ARSnova.

32
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:20,882
With each graphic, you get an idea of what server resources and load levels are measurable and what they mean.

33
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:27,082
What they mean, you can find out when you have a look at Wikipedia.

34
00:06:27,332 --> 00:06:39,922
On this page, I have prepared two discussion threads:

35
00:06:40,172 --> 00:07:02,762
1. What performance metrics are the most important to measure and control server capacity planning?

36
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:09,402
I recommend reading the free eBook "The Art of Capacity Planning".

37
00:07:09,652 --> 00:07:34,322
The book is quite new and introduces you to the technical terms, methods, technologies, and tools you need even as a developer.

38
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:40,962
Finally, the homework assignment.

39
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:55,642
It's not easy to phrase such an assignment, but I hope the six instructions make it fairly clear.

40
00:07:55,892 --> 00:08:04,442
The task is very realistic and could be part of a real project.

41
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:11,042
Please note the green links and follow them

42
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:17,842
In this task, we run two testing scenarios in parallel :

43
00:08:18,092 --> 00:08:26,842
With a different degree of force and representing different use cases.

44
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:43,842
In the introductory video I mentioned that we had implemented such a testing environment for the Deutsche Bahn project (www.bahn.de) which was very complex.

45
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:58,962
To give you an idea, this website included more than 150 use cases that we had to understand. 

46
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:02,712
These use cases needed to be understood in their utilization, in their quantity structure.

47
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:26,002
Then, these use cases had to be represented in a tool for 1000 simultaneous users. In this case, we didn't use JMeter but a tool that costs several 100,000 of Euros.These use cases had to be implemented with the defined Service Level Agreements.

48
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:33,482
Please don't rush into the homework assignment, but take the long way through the individual units.

49
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:39,082
You are expected to invest about 8 hours of your time into a chapter and you will need this time.

50
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:45,042
Now, let's have a look at the preview:

51
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:58,682
You will have create a couchDB dump in your vagrant-production machine.

52
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:11,602
and zip that dump file together with your JMeter test plan. Then, upload the zip file to the iversity platform.

53
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:26,282
In the peer review, you will have to ask a question in ARSnova while the background load defined by the test plan is running.

54
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:40,682
The reviewer is supposed to take on the role of a real user and evaluate the user experience under load.

55
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:49,242
The reviewer will also grade if you have prepared everything according to the instructions.

56
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:59,802
The quality of the test plan will be evaluated according to the scheme you can see here.

57
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:20,122
We hope that this video helps you to get the next homework assignments done economically and in a reasonable manner from the point of view of Educational Psychology.
